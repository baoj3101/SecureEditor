<p><strong>Jython 2.7 Beta 2 Released</strong> (May 2013)</p>
<p>Jython 2.7b2 brings us up to language level compatibility with the 2.7 version
of CPython. We have focused largely on CPython compatibility, and so this
release of Jython can run more pure Python apps then any previous release.
Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes. This is primarily a bugfix
release, with numerous improvements, including much improvement on Windows
support.</p>

<p><strong>PyDev 3.4.1 Available</strong> (May 2013)</p>
<p>Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org">PyDev Site</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>PyDev 3.0 Released</strong> (November 2013)</p>
<p>From now on, PyDev requires Eclipse 3.7 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x.</p>
<p>Interpreter is now kept up to date with changes to the interpreter, so, pip-installing packages will automatically update internal caches without requiring a manual step.</p>
<p>Fixed issue connecting to shell for code-completion (which could halt the IDE).
Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://pydev.org">PyDev Site</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>JyNI 2.7-alpha 2 Released</strong> (October 2013)</p>
<p>JyNI is a compatibility layer with the goal to enable Jython to use native CPython extensions like NumPy or SciPy. This way we aim to enable scientific Python code to run on Jython. Since Java is rather present in industry, while Python is more present in science, JyNI is an important step to lower the cost of using scientific code in industrial environments.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to integrate JyNI with Jython and CPython extensions as seamless as possible. So JyNI aims to work without any recompilation of Jython or the desired CPython extensions. It neither requires a customized Jython version, nor customized versions of the CPython extensions (of course your JyNI version must meet the platform your CPython extension was build for). Simply put JyNI.jar on the classpath (along with its native libraries) and Jython should �magically� be able to load native extensions, as far as the needed Python C-API is already implemented by JyNI.</p>

<p><strong>Customizing Jython ProxyMaker</strong> (Wednesday, January 9, 2013)</p>
<p>I just got a set of patches under &quot;Customizable ProxyMaker&quot; umbrella committed into Jython 2.7. In this post i will try to explain a bit of what Jython's ProxyMaker is and what benefits the ability to customize/override brings for interop with Java.</p>

<p><strong>Jython Dev Notes Part 2:  Adding a New Builtin Type</strong> (Monday February 13, 2012)</p>
<p>Releases of Python (and so releases of Jython) sometimes add new built-in types. In 2.6, a new such buitin is the &quot;bytes&quot; type. In the 2.x series, &quot;bytes&quot; is just a synonym for &quot;str&quot;. In 3.x &quot;bytes&quot; is the name used for 8 bit strings while &quot;str&quot; is a unicode string (and so the &quot;unicode&quot; type disappears in 3.x). This will make it a great example for adding a builtin since there is no added functionality to obscure the basics.  <a class="reference external" href="http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/2012/02/jython-dev-notes-part-ii-adding-new.html">Visit Post - Jython Dev Notes Part 2</a></p>
<p><strong>Jython Dev Notes Part 1:  The Jython Exposer</strong> (Monday January 2, 2012)</p>
<p>One of my new years resolutions is to make Jython more friendly to new developers. One way to do that is to write up some notes on bits of Jython that are particularly mysterious to newcomers. I've boldly titled this post &quot;Jython dev notes part I&quot; to push myself to create more than one of these :) <a class="reference external" href="http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/2012/01/jython-dev-notes-part-i-jython-exposer.html">Visit Post -  Jython Dev Notes Part 1</a></p>

<p><strong>Project Sikuli Released</strong> (January 28, 2010)</p>
<p>Sikuli is a visual technology to search and automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) using images (screenshots). The first release of Sikuli contains Sikuli Script, a visual scripting API for Jython, and Sikuli IDE, an integrated development environment for writing visual scripts with screenshots easily. Sikuli Script automates anything you see on the screen without internal API's support. You can programmatically control a web page, a desktop application running on Windows/Linux/Mac OS X, or even an iphone application running in an emulator.

<p><strong>Jython Doc Set Updated</strong> (November 08, 2009)</p>
<p>The Jython <a class="reference external" href="http://jython.org/currentdocs.html">documentation</a> set has been updated to include all modules contained within the Jython standard library.  However, it should be noted that this is still a work in progress since many of these documents have not yet been parsed and tested completely with Jython 2.5.1.  Stay tuned for more updates on the doc set!</p>

<h2>Jython 2.5 Documentation</h2>
<p>The documentation for Jython 2.5 is being developed on our <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/jython">wiki</a>.  Please help
Jython by adding content and updating our wiki. As the content matures for 2.5
it will be pulled back into this website.</p>
<p>You may also wish to check the <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jython-users">jython-users</a> mailing list archives as many questions and answers can be found there.</p>
